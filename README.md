# Simple-Python-Game
A simple text based game that is based on the Fire Emblem game series

Hitting run on the script will execute the "tournament" function. The user will be asked to input names for 4 characters,
then stats will be randomly generated and used to determine which character would win in a fight.
There are several functions for creating characters, as well as a handful of extra functions for ways to have them fight.
